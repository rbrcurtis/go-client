For every point of handicap (to a max of 4) the opponent we'll find for you may be a rank higher or lower than you.  Whoever is of lowest rank will also get a number of bonus stones equal to the handicap, and the lowest rank person always moves first.  This setting is only used when challenging a random opponent.
